    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Toronto, a city in southeast Canada, capital of the province of Ontario, located in the southern part of the province, on the shores of Lake Ontario and at the mouth of the Humber and Don rivers. \n",
    "The city is the economic, commercial, industrial and cultural centre of the country and the largest metropolitan area in Canada.  Toronto is the largest city in Ontario and the second most populous in Canada. Today, it is a cosmopolitan city that is home to many different cultures and ethnicities.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to immigration data in Canada, for 2010, Ontario received 41% of all immigrants to that country from countries such as the Philippines, India, China, United Kingdom, among others, being this the province with the largest number of immigrants in the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "The causes of migration can be various: the search for a better quality of life and work opportunities, or simply a labour obligation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the high level of immigration, this research aims to help families with children who arrive in Toronto to be able to locate themselves permanently with ease in the neighbourhoods that best suit their needs and where the price of the houses is acceptable to their socio-economic status."
