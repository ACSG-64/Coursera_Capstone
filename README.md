# The best neighborhoods in Toronto for a middle class family with underage children - Report.
**Abstract**
Toronto is the city in Canada that receives more immigrants daily from all over the world since it is the economic epicentre of the country and is a very pleasant city to live in. With this in mind, this research is intended to provide a list of recommended neighbourhoods for a middle-class immigrant family with children to settle in the city permanently. To do this, we will explore the services offered by each neighborhood, the security of the neighborhood, and the price of the homes through the use of open data and geolocation services.
